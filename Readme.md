# CopernicusEngine
Multi-purpose Vulkan render engine specialized for physics simulation and solar system visualization

## Introduction
Work-In-Progress Vulkan render engine
Current structure:
- Flexible render graph system with multiple render passes
- Deferred rendering
- PBR (IBL is WIP), cascaded shadows, normal mapping (MikkTSpace tangents optional)
- GLTF loading and rendering, primitive creation and rendering.

Work-In-Progress
- [ ] IBL
- [ ] TAA
- [ ] Multiple light
- [ ] SSR
- [ ] SSAO, bloom
- [ ] Planet Rendering
